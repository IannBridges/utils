# utils 

A collection of utility scripts that I use for either writing, programming, or 
doing mathematics. Each script has a multi-line comment at the beginning that 
explains its functionality in greater detail. 

- ptree.py: A script I use to generate my theorem trees so that they are more 
  visually appealing.
